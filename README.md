# COVID-19 and Air Pollution
## Exploring the effect of COVID-19 in air pollution, using NO2 data from the Sentinel-5p satellite

I used the `sentinelsat` , `harp` and `cartopy` libraries to download, process and visualize the NO<sub>2</sub> satellite data.
If you wish to do similar analysis on a different country/region, it is easy to modify the python scripts to accomplish that.
