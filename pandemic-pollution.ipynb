    "# Air Pollution and the COVID-19 Pandemic\n",
    "\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented disruption in every aspect of human activity, on a global scale. Billions of people have been affected by the disease in numerous ways, and felt its impact in their daily lives. Fortunately and perhaps unexpectedly, the pandemic had a few beneficial effects as well. The various measures implemented by governments all over the world, like travel restrictions, border closures and lockdowns, have led to the decrease of air pollution in many countries. Air pollution is itself a major health issue, causing millions of deaths on a yearly basis. In this notebook we are going to explore the decrease of air pollution during the COVID-19 pandemic in various cities, using satellite data."
